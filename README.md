## Description:
We were tasked with creating a Node.js command-line application that takes in team member information for a software engineering team and genrates an HTML webpage to neatly display each team members role and relevant contact information.  I also wrote tests using Jest to ensure that the data being passed in is accurate and meets criteria.  As this application will not be deployed a brief video demonstration link is provided below to showcase the functionality of the command-line application.
